      <h2>An Honest Memory, Inspired by the Past</h2>
      
      <p>Hbuk(hbuk.xyz), which stands for History Books, is a private journal that does not let you edit the past. The book "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius, a private journal never meant for publication, was a subconscious inspiration for this. You can type entries yourself, or you can let smart devices like SaifCam (for video) and SafeSound (for audio) send short, factual summaries into your timeline. Hbuk saves the useful facts, not piles of raw media.</p>
      
      <p>"Safesound(safesound.ai) and Saifcam(saifcam.com) are in development, for now we want to wrap them with Gemini 2.5 flash"</p>
      
      <p>Every entry gets a small cryptographic seal. Think of it as a unique code that is made from what you wrote, when you wrote it, and a few key details. Each day, we publish a single daily seal that proves which entries existed that day. This is not a blockchain. It is simple, standard cryptography used in a careful and honest way.</p>

      <h2>You Are in Control: Three Simple Modes for a Privacy-First Future</h2>
      
      <p>We believe the future of technology is personal, private, and powerful. The world is moving away from giant, centralized AI and towards smaller, more efficient models that run on our own devices. Hbuk is designed for this future. We give you three clear and simple modes so you can choose exactly how your data is used.</p>

      <h3>Mode One: Me Only (The Journal)</h3>
      <p>This is the ultimate in privacy, for your thoughts alone. Nothing is sent to any AI model. You can type entries or approve device summaries, and only the short, sealed text is saved to your Hbuk. Your data is never used for training, and no raw media ever leaves your devices. This is your private, permanent journal with cryptographic receipts, and nothing more.</p>

      <h3>Mode Two: Private on the Edge (Your Personal AI)</h3>
      <p>This is the future of personal intelligence. You use small, powerful language models that run on your own hardware. All processing happens on your camera, your hub, or your phone. Hbuk receives only the short, final facts. We use the data from your private environment to train and fine-tune a smaller, specialized AI model that works only for you. It is your personal lifestyle coach, your private kitchen inspector, your unique team analyst. Your data stays local, and the intelligence it creates belongs to you.</p>

      <h3>Mode Three: License to Market (The Data Gold Mine)</h3>
      <p>This is for those who want to contribute to the future of AI and be rewarded for it. You can choose to license your high-fidelity, verifiable data to the larger corporations and AI labs that are starving for it. Quality food for LLMs is the need of the hour, and your real-world data is a gold mine. This mode allows you to monetize your authentic data, helping to train the next generation of global AI models while earning a share of the value you create.</p>

      <p>You can switch modes at any time, for your whole account or for a single device. You are in complete control.</p>

      <h2>The Grand Vision: A New Infrastructure for Truth</h2>
      
      <p>Our world is being built on artificial intelligence. But that AI is being trained on the chaotic, often unreliable data of the public internet. The future of AI depends on a new source of food: high-quality, structured, and verifiable data that is created with consent.</p>
      
      <p>This is our big goal.</p>
      
      <p>The Hbuk ecosystem is not just a tool for you; it is an engine for creating the most valuable AI training data ever conceived. The immutable, timestamped, and verified events from SaifCam and SafeSound create a "high-fidelity" record of reality. This is the data that will be used to train the next generation of smaller, more efficient, and more intelligent AI models that can run on our own devices.</p>
      
      <p>By using Hbuk, you are not just documenting your own life; you are contributing to a collective conscience. You are helping to build a future where AI learns from truth, not from noise.</p>

      <h2>Where We Are Going</h2>
      
      <p>Our commitment is to you. We will keep moving more processing to the edge, so more of your data stays in your hands. We will keep improving the structure of your entries while keeping the cryptographic seal honest. We will do this without ever giving up on privacy.</p>
      
      <p>Begin with Me Only if you want a quiet, private journal. Turn on Assist in the Cloud if you want easy automation right now. Choose Private on the Edge if you want the help of small models that run on your own devices. Pick what fits your life, and change it when your needs change.</p>
      
      <p>Hbuk gives you an honest memory. Private first. Verifiable when you choose.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      
      <h3>Can I edit an entry?</h3>
      <p>No. You can add another entry or hide one with a tombstone. The point is to keep history honest.</p>
      
      <h3>Do you store my raw video/audio?</h3>
      <p>No. Hbuk stores summaries. SaifCam/SafeSound aim to do more processing on your own devices over time.</p>
      
      <h3>Can I get my data out?</h3>
      <p>Yes—export anytime.</p>
      
      <h3>Is this blockchain?</h3>
      <p>No. Just straightforward cryptography.</p>

      <h2>Try it</h2>
      
      <p>Start journaling in Solo mode.</p>
      <p>Connect devices in Home mode when you're ready.</p>
      <p>Share a single proof in Share mode if you need to show something happened—without exposing the rest of your life.</p>
