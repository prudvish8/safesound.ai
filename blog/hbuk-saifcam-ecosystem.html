      <h1>Introducing the HBUK and Saifcam ecosystem</h1>
      <div class="meta">31/08/2025 • 2-3 min read</div>

      <p class="lead">
        SafeSound turns real life into structured, verifiable records you control. Saifcam captures what happens around you.
        HBUK anchors those events in an immutable truth book so anyone can verify later that nothing changed.
      </p>

      <div class="callout info">
        <strong>TL;DR</strong>
        Edge-first capture → structured events → signed and committed to HBUK → optional summaries for humans → your chosen data-rights mode governs export or training.
      </div>

      <h2>An honest memory, inspired by the past</h2>
      <p><a href="https://hbuk.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBUK</a> stands for History Books: a private, append-only journal. You can write entries yourself, or let devices like <strong>Saifcam</strong> (video) and <strong>SafeSound</strong> (audio) send short, factual summaries into your timeline - saving the useful facts, not piles of raw media.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Safesound (safesound.ai) and Saifcam (saifcam.com) are in development. v0 is wrapped with Gemini 2.5 Flash while we move toward compact on-device models."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Every entry receives a small cryptographic seal derived from what you wrote, when you wrote it, and key details. Each UTC day, a single daily anchor proves which entries existed that day. This is <em>not</em> a blockchain - just straightforward cryptography applied carefully.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>You control the data: three privacy modes</h2>
      <p>Technology is shifting from giant, centralized AI to smaller models that run on your own hardware. HBUK is built for that future. Choose one of these modes - per account or per device - and switch any time.</p>

      <div class="mode-grid">
        <section class="mode">
          <h3>Mode 1 - Me only</h3>
          <p>The private journal. No model access. Short, sealed text only. No raw media leaves your devices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best for private reflections</li>
            <li>No training or external use</li>
            <li>Cryptographic receipts for every entry</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mode">
          <h3>Mode 2 - Private on the edge</h3>
          <p>Your personal AI. Small models run on your camera, hub, or phone; HBUK stores only the final facts.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Train and fine-tune models that work only for you</li>
            <li>Data stays local to your tenant</li>
            <li>Great for lifestyle coaching and inspections</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mode">
          <h3>Mode 3 - License to market</h3>
          <p>Monetize your high-fidelity, verifiable events by licensing them to vetted buyers/LLMs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear licenses and payouts per accepted event</li>
            <li>Revocable for future exports</li>
            <li>Feeds the next generation of models</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </div>

      <div class="callout tip">
        <strong>Switch any time</strong>
        Apply a mode to your whole account or to a single device. Your choice always wins.
      </div>

      <h2>How the pieces work together</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Edge capture:</strong> Saifcam observes video and emits structured events.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence → JSON:</strong> detections become time-stamped JSON with minimal, useful context.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign &amp; commit:</strong> events are signed and written to HBUK's append-only log.</li>
        <li><strong>Anchors:</strong> daily Merkle-style roots prove what existed that day.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional summaries:</strong> Gemini Flash v0 for short human-readable notes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where we're going</h2>
      <p>We're moving more processing to the edge so more of your data stays in your hands. We'll keep improving structure, keep the cryptographic seal honest, and never compromise on privacy.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Can I edit an entry?</summary>
          <p>No. You can add a new entry or hide with a tombstone. The point is to keep history honest.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you store raw video or audio?</summary>
          <p>No. HBUK stores summaries. Saifcam and SafeSound move processing onto your devices over time.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I export my data?</summary>
          <p>Yes - export anytime. Your data, your terms.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is this blockchain?</summary>
          <p>No. It's standard cryptography with daily anchors for verifiability.</p>
        </details>
      </div>

      <hr/>

      <p><span class="kicker">Try it</span></p>
      <p>Start journaling in Me Only mode. Connect Saifcam when you're ready. Share a single proof when you need to show something happened - without exposing the rest of your life.</p>
