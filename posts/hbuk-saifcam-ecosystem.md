# Introducing the HBUK and Saifcam ecosystem

SafeSound helps you turn real life into structured, verifiable records you control. Saifcam captures what happens around you. HBUK anchors those events in an immutable truth book so anyone can verify later that nothing changed.

## Why SafeSound
People should own their reality data. Keep it private by default, share on your terms, and use it to automate your life, train small local models, or license it to partners.

## Products working together
- **Saifcam** handles the vision input. v0 uses hosted Gemini Flash for short clips and structured summaries. Over time we move to compact models on the device for privacy and speed.  
- **HBUK** is the append-only log. Each entry is hashed, signed, and included in a daily anchor.

## Use cases
- Hygiene and safety checks in kitchens and labs  
- Ingredient and tool traceability with QR, OCR and freshness cues  
- Lifestyle coaching summaries captured as high-fidelity notes

## Privacy modes
- **Private by default**: nothing leaves your device unless you choose to share.  
- **Share to improve**: you can opt in to share redacted snippets to improve models.  
- **Open source license**: for some datasets, you can choose to license pseudonymous data for public research.

## Roadmap
We start with 5-minute clips, then increase duration. The long-term path is edge-first SLMs that run locally and respect data rights by design.
